# Predicting Locations from Google Street View using Deep Learning

The objective of this project is to generate a dataset of Google Street View images and develop a deep learning model capable of predicting geographic locations based solely on Google Street View images. Inspired by the game GeoGuessr, the task involves training a model to infer the approximate location of an image by analyzing visual cues such as terrain, architecture, vegetation, and road signs. 

The scraped street view images were not included in this repository, but can be accessed in [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F0CrO51kXwTlBKGeVgIlfDGdCg33ueLF?usp=drive_link).
